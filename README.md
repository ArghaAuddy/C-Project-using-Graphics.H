# C++-Project-using-Graphics.H
HELLO GUYS,
THIS IS ARGHA AUDDY.
I TRIED TO MAKE TWO PROJECTS OR TO BE MORE SPECIFIC I USED GRAPHICS.H HEADERFILE IN TURBO C++ TO MAKE ANIMATION ON MOVING CYCLE AND ALSO A SMILEY FACE.
USING BUILT IN FUNCTIONS LIKE outtextxy , settextstyle, floodfill,SOLID_COLOUR ,circle,rectangle etc IT WAS FUN CONSTRUCTING THESE TWO PROJECTS .ALTHOUGH THE CODE FOR THE FIRST ONE IS QUITE BIG BUT ONE CAN COMPREHEND IT EASILY BY PAYING LITTLE INTEREST AND WILL SURELY UNDERSTAND IT .
I AM HAPPY IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED TO VIEW THESE PROJECTS AND I AM HAPPY IF THE CODE HELPS ANY .
IN THE END IT WAS FUN MAKING THESE PROJECTS.
